# Generate faBolus.xcodeproj, making Garmin (Connect IQ SDK) and the Apple Watch app OPTIONAL so the
# app compiles/installs for users who don't have them.
#
#   - Garmin: auto-detected. If the Connect IQ SDK vendor folder is absent, the ConnectIQ package +
#     dependency are removed from the spec and the GARMIN compile flag is dropped, so nothing links or
#     imports the SDK. Override with FABOLUS_GARMIN=0/1.
#   - Apple Watch: on by default. Set FABOLUS_WATCH=0 to build the phone app without embedding the
#     watch app (drops the embed dependency + the WATCH_EMBEDDED flag).
#   - On-watch eating detection (Phase 5, step 6): OFF by default because it needs the **paid**
#     HealthKit entitlement (an HKWorkoutSession keeps CoreMotion alive). When off, every paid-only
#     piece (the HealthKit entitlement, WKBackgroundModes/NSMotion keys, the EatingDetectionKit deps,
#     the bundled model, and the FABOLUS_ONWATCH_EATING compile flag) is stripped, so the app builds
#     and installs on a **free** Apple account. Turn it on with FABOLUS_ONWATCH_EATING=1 once you've
#     enabled HealthKit on a paid account. The Garmin eating path (phone-side inference) needs none of
#     this and works regardless.
#
# When a feature is off, the app shows a note where its pairing/setup would be, explaining it wasn't
# included at build time. Re-run with the SDK present / FABOLUS_WATCH=1 to restore it.
#
# Requires: xcodegen. Writes a derived spec (project.generated.yml, gitignored) and generates from it.
