# How it works

A quick tour of the pieces and who's responsible for what. You don't need this to build or use
the app — it's here if you're curious or want to contribute.

## The big picture

**One rule organizes everything: only the iPhone talks to the pump.** The Apple Watch and Garmin
are *remotes* — they send requests to the iPhone, which owns the single Bluetooth connection,
runs the safety interlocks, and does the actual delivery.

!!! note "The Garmin app lives in its own repo"
    The Garmin (Monkey C) app lives in the separate
    **[faBolusGarmin](https://github.com/faBolus-app/faBolusGarmin)** repo. The *iPhone side* of the
    Garmin bridge (`GarminRemoteBridge`, the Connect IQ Mobile SDK dependency) is part of this app,
    so the two talk over the shared command contract.

## Who owns the pump

The iPhone owns the single Bluetooth control connection and runs **PumpX2Kit**. Remotes (Apple
Watch, Garmin) are thin clients that send commands to the phone; the phone runs the confirm
interlock and delivers. A standalone Apple Watch that runs PumpX2Kit on-watch (no phone) is
designed but not built.

## The command contract

`schema/command.schema.json` defines the tiny phone↔remote protocol — fields like `kind`,
`requestId`, `units`, `carbsGrams`, `bgMgdl`, `confirmToken`, and `status`. Both the Swift side
(`faBolusCore/RemoteCommand.swift`) and the Monkey C side generate and validate against it, which is
what keeps the watch, Garmin, and phone from drifting apart.

## Byte-exact protocol

Every outgoing pump message in PumpX2Kit is asserted **byte-for-byte equal** to the pumpX2
`cliparser` oracle in tests, and CI re-runs this on every push. A scheduled CI job watches for
upstream protocol drift. This is what makes a hand-ported dosing protocol trustworthy — see the
[PumpX2Kit](https://github.com/faBolus-app/PumpX2Kit) repo.
